# (WIP) Spotify to Youtube 
## Background 
- Spotify was introduced to Korea in 2021, making it a streaming app with relatively small number of users
- I'm a big music lover and I use Spotify.
- However a huge proportion of my friends are not using Spotify. 
- I decided to create youtube playlists to share my spotify playlists to my friends.

## Purpose of this code 
- Read a users's spotify playlist and makes it into a youtube playlist. 
- Share the playlist with your friends who do not use Spotify.
- Enjoy! 


## Description 
- Currently WIP(Work in Progress) 
  - I'll be working on making it more stable and suitable for everyone 
  - I'll be adding a more detailed README.md to inform how credentials for this project could be acquired. 
- Process 
  - Get a user's playlists by using OAuth 
  - User selects the playlist he/she wants to migrate 
  - User logs into his/her Google Account using OAuth 
  - The program creates a youtube playlist based on the user's spotify playlist.
